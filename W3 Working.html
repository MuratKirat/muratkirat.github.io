	<p style="color:blue;">HTML is composed of elements.</p><p>HTML uses these elements to describe the structure of pages. A tag and the content between it is called an HTML element. Elements are usually made up of two tags: An opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag is also called the starting tag, and the closing tag is called the end tag. Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that is between its opening and closing tags</p>
